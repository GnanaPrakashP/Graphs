Problem Statement

You are trapped in a 2D dungeon and need to find the quickest way out. The dungeon is composed of unit cubes which may or may not be filled with rock. It takes one 
minute to move one unit north, south, east, west. You cannot move diagonally and the maze is surrounded by solid rock on all sides. Is it possible to escape ?

Input 

First line contains two numbers rows and columns. Next row lines contains strings of length equal to column. Where "." represents empty cell and "#" represents cell 
contains rock. Next two line represent the starting and ending cordinates.

Output

If possible to escape then output two lines first line contains "Yes" and the second line contains shortest the path from the starting node to endind node. 
It not possible to escape then output "No".

Sample Input

5 7
...#...
.#...#.
.#.....
..##...
#.#..#.
0 0
4 3

Sample Output

Yes
(0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(2,4)->(3,4)->(4,4)->(4,3)

Problem Idea

BFS Approch and inorder to store the cordinates into a single queue use two queues and store the x-cordinate into one queue and y-cordinate into the other queue.
