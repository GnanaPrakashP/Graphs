Problem Statement

We will be having an undirected tree and we need to convert this undirected tree to a rooted tree.

Input

The undirected tree is represented in the adjacency list

Output

Output an rooted tree rooted at some vertex

Problem Idea

This is generally done using DFS

Solution

n = number of nodes in a tree
vector<int> visited(n,0);
void dfs(map<int,vector<int>> &m,int node)
{
     if(visited[node])
         return;
     visited[node]=1;
     vector<int> temp=m[node];
     for(int i=0;i<temp.size();i++)
         dfs(m,temp[i]);
     return;
}
